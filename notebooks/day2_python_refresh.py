# Day 2 — Python Syntax Refresh (Java → Python)

## Key differences noticed
- Less boilerplate than Java (e.g., sets/dicts)
- Indentation replaces braces
- Dynamic typing: fast prototyping

## Things practiced
- strings, loops, if/elif/else
- list / tuple / dict / set
- small problems:
  - char frequency
  - duplicates in list
  - reverse words

## Reflection
Python feels faster to write; need to be careful about readability and implicit behavior.
